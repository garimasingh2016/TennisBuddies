# TennisBuddies
IB Computer Science HL Senior Project
This project was mae in my senior year of high school. 
It is intended to connect tennis players with each other to find partners to practice with. Players that create accounts in the application can be matched with other players based on preferences.
The project was created from feedback given by tennis players in the Austin area.
